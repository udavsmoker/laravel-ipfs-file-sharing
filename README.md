# Sharey - IPFS File Transfer Platform

Sharey is a decentralized file transfer platform built on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to securely and efficiently share files across a distributed network. It aims to provide a user-friendly and secure alternative for file sharing by leveraging the power of IPFS for decentralized storage and fast retrieval.

## Features

- **Decentralized File Sharing**: Files are stored across a distributed network, ensuring redundancy and availability without relying on a central server.
- **Secure File Transfers**: Utilizes encryption to ensure files are securely transferred between users, protecting them from unauthorized access.
- **Easy Upload and Download**: Upload and download large files with ease, making it suitable for a variety of use cases, from personal to business-related file transfers.
- **Minimal Latency**: The system leverages IPFS's high-speed content retrieval, allowing users to access shared files faster than traditional file-sharing methods.

## Usage

- Upload files by selecting them from your device and clicking the "Upload" button.
- To download files, enter the unique file hash (CID) and click "Download".
- Share file hashes with others to allow them to download files directly from the IPFS network.

## Security

Sharey ensures the security of your files by encrypting them during transmission. Files are only accessible by users who have the proper access credentials, ensuring that unauthorized access is prevented.
