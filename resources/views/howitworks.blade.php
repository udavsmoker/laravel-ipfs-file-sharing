            <h2>Security You Can Trust</h2>
            <p>Our service employs state-of-the-art encryption algorithms (AES-256) to ensure your files are securely stored. With optional password protection and encrypted storage, your data is safe from unauthorized access.</p>
            <p>We never store your passwordâ€”only a hashed version of it. This ensures that even if someone gains unauthorized access to our servers, your data remains secure and inaccessible to them.</p>

            <h2>File Retention Policy</h2>
            <p>Your uploaded files are stored temporarily on our servers. After a certain period, the files will be automatically deleted to free up space, ensuring optimal performance for all users.</p>
            <p>However, if you need to keep your files safe for a longer period, we offer the option to <strong>pin your files</strong> to the node permanently by upgrading to a Pro account. This ensures that your files will remain accessible for as long as you need them.</p>

            <h2>Upgrade to Pro for Permanent File Retention</h2>
            <p>Switching to Pro gives you the ability to pin your files to the node indefinitely. No matter how long you need access to them, they'll remain securely stored and accessible.</p>
            <p>With a Pro account, you can also enjoy other benefits, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unlimited file uploads</li>
